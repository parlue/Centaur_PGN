This is a merge of two projects about the DGT Centaur 

EdNekebo spend a lot of time to describe the internal interfaces. With my Unix experience I will megre the best of both sides to a really potential project.
It was a long way to go before it was possible to expand the DGT Centaur software with new functions. Big thanks to Ed Nekebno, who made the work on the DGT Centaur a lot easier with his decompilation. 
I spend alot time to bring it on a new OS and finalize the lichess modul.
This version will be available as an Image for PI Zwero W and later a small Version for the original Pi Zero Board.
There are some differents to the original branch. If you miss feature, you can follow Ed's project.
