This is a merge of two projects about the DGT Centaur
EdNekebo spend a lot of time to describe the internal interfaces. With my Unix experience I will megre the best of both sides to a really potential project.
It was a long way to go before it was possible to expand the DGT Centaur software with new functions. Big thanks to Ed Nekebno, who
made the work on the DGT Centaur a lot easier with his decompilation.
